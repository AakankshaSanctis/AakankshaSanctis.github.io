Identified salient features in input images and generated adversarial masks using various techniques such as saliency gradient maps, GRAD-CAM and random patch masking. Created non-private representations of the input images using latent diffusion models, so that private information is not transmitted to downstream tasks such as FaceNetâ€™s recognition model.
